PMP Certification - project management certification

Three Main Styles of Project Management:

1.  Agile
      Sprint- possibly 1 or 2 weeks long, durring which you plan out what you want
      to get done. After 2 weeks you should be able to report back that you're done
      w/ that feature you were tasked w/.
      If you can't get it done, go out to meetups etc. and ask for help! Be up front
      w/ your project manager
2.  Scrum
      Very similar to Agile

3.  ConBon
      Quicker report times. After every feature you complete you report back. You
      could be reporting back every day. Can be very stressful.. Banjo.io in Vegas
      does this style.


https://sprint.ly     Watch how projects are going in real-time. You can make stories,
      tasks, defects, or tests to help with implementing new ideas and features.
      "As an 'accountant', I want 'some new feature' because 'reason'."

www.pivotaltracker.com      You can rate taks on a 1-3 scale. Gives you different
      buckets to put your tasks in.

https://basecamp.com      A general overview project mgmt. tool. The first rails
      app, created by DHH. 

Any project meeting should be 15 minutes only, but you meet often.
