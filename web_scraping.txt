Web Scraping
________________________________________________________________________________

You can scrape publicly accessible info from the web such as, arrest and marriage records,
  trading information etc.
If a website doesn't have an API, start scraping it!
Yelp has an API to get its data.

Gems for scraping:
__________________

gem 'mechanize' *can't accept javascript. Its a headless browser, it all happens inside
                  of the terminal. It's faster than water

gem 'watir' *can't use on Heroku. A little slower, but parses CSS, runs Javascript, and
              downloads images.
              Watir opens a zombie browser and completely controls it through the terminal.
