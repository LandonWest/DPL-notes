Git Information:

First, in Terminal navigate to your directory (folder) and type: "Atom ." to open the folders in Atom
In Atom, green the green bar to the left of a number line signifies changes to the line.
A file highlighted green signifies a file is new. Highlighted orange signifies the file has been changed.
Make sure to SAVE your files, and that will be signified by the blue circle on the tab changing to an "x".

To "stage commits" locally in Terminal type:
first:   git status                              (to check the status of the repository)
second:  git add filename.txt                    (to specify file to add commit)
third:   git commit -m "description of changes"  (to note what changes you made)
last:    git push                                (to update the "master depository" on github.com)

.gitignore is a file that you can put other files or info in that you want to be ignored. ex. a password list that you don't want broadcast publicly.

git add .  (This will add all changes at once instead of having to add them seperately)

git branch                          (Lists the available branches and denotes which one you're on by an asteric*)
git checkout branch_name            (switches to the specified branch)
git checkout -b new_branch_name     (creates new branch)
git push origin branch_name         (use this instead of just "push" to push the branch changes to github.com)
git merge branch_name               (To merge a branch to another. ex. To merge "sample" branch to "master" branch, first make sure you're on the master branch by using "git checkout master" to switch to it, and "git branch" to double check you're on it, Then use "git merge sample". Last use "git push origin master" to push it to github.com)
