JOB SEARCH
________________________________________________________________________________

Prepare- do your research on the company
  -first and foremost, they're looking for how well you fit-in with the company
  -be confident, not arrogant, you don't have to know everything
  -a place like Instructure will want you to wear a shirt/tie. Reddit would probly be fine
      with jeans and a shirt. It depends on the company

  -if you go in to an interview and bomb all the questions, you're probably not good enough, so
        you need to practice, practice, practice!

  -if you don't get hired, it's ok to follow up with them and ask them why you didn't get hire.
      a lot of times senior developers are happy to help you out and let you know what you can work on.

  -ask other people what questions they are getting in their interviews. Sometimes
      companies use the same white-board challenges, etc.

  -be an eternal student! Continue to code and learn new things as you're looking for a job.
      Quintin came back for 3 more months after graduation and continued to learn and ask
        questions, and then was able to get hired as a mid-level developer.

  -the first thing we should do when we're outa here is make and work on a portfolio site. check out: benegget.com

  -white-board/logic question - they're looking for the process, not the solution. Figure out
      what the steps are and how you would solve it and don't worry as much about coding it perfectly.

  -practice the tough questions: 'what are your weaknesses' etc.
  -ask some questions yourself.
