EMAIL

Mailers - act like controllers. have actions and views

most common mailer is the user mailer, which handles emailing the user
also common is the admin mailer, which emails stuff to the admin
notification mailer, notifies different people

> rails g mailer notification_mailer
  (make sure to put _mailer at the end)

app/mailers/notification_mailer.rb


-create a new view file named after your mailer class



in development mode it doesn't actually send emails


Styling Emails:
-most email clients don't support html5 or CSS3 or loading external files,
  you have to use html4 and CSS2
-you'll be using p tags, possibly div's, and tables
-you'll have to do all your styles inline

There are services for email testing, such as:
  Litmus.com
    -this boots up a bunch of different servers of email clients and emails you what
      it will look like in each. This is called 'cross-platform testing'

test/mailers/previews/notification_mailer_preview.rb



STEPS:

1. Generate mailer

> rails g mailer user_mailer

2. Open user_mailer

  app/mailers/user_mailer.rb

3. configure user_mailer
  default from:

4. create mailer action

  class UserMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  default from: "no-reply@myapp.co.uk"

    def welcome(user_email)
      @user_email = user_email
      mail(to: @user_email, subject: 'Welcome to the club')
    end
  end

5. make sure we have a view thats named the same as the action

app/view/user_mailer   new file: welcome.html.erb

6. put stuff in your view

7.  add this line to site controller

    def login
      UserMailer.welcome('dude@party.house').deliver
      redirect_to root_path
    end

8. test/mailer/preview/user_mailer_preview.rb

    class UserMailerPreview < ActionMailer::Preview

      def welcome
        UserMailer.welcome('billy@cheese.co')
      end

    end


9. go to localhost:3000/rails/mailers      to see what your email looks like

mailchimp.com      you send email from app to mailchimp, mailchimp analyses and processes it,
                    then mailchimp sends the actual email. That way because gmail trusts mailchimp,
                      they won't put the mail in spam folders.

sendgrid.com       basically the same as mailchimp

postmarkapp.com    basically the same as mailchimp


You can go to addons.heroku.com and add these companies to your app






Practice:
admin mailer that'll email me report of how many users are in the db (some random number)
click a button , should send email from admin mailer to send report of how many user in db
