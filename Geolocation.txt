GEOLOCATION

Lattitude and Longitude (are floats)

GeoCoding
  taking an address and converting it to lattitude and longitude
Reverse GeoCoding
  taking the lattitude and longitude and converting it to an address


You can do GeoCoding from an IP Address, which means if someone has your IP Address
  they can find exactly where you are!


Ruby GeoCoder Gem ,  Rubygeocoder.com


GeoCoding requires the use of an external service (a third party API, like google maps,
  downside is google limits you to 2500 geocoding requests in a day, you can pay for
  google business premier which gives you 100,000/day but for $10,000 a year!)

there is a database of geocodes from MaxMind that you can use that has every city in the world's geocodes, but the file is MASSIVE

  Other APIs:
  Yahoo Boss
  Bing
  Nominatim
  Yandex (25000/day, but is really slow)
  Geocoder.ca (only for us and candada)
  Mapquest
  GeoCode Farm (Jeremy has a GeoCoder fork of the gem on his github)
  etc...
