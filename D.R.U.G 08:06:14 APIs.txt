Wrapping APIs with Ruby
________________________________________________________________________________

Request Methods:

API Content Type:
-Json   -the most used.  jsonapi.org
-XML
-HTML
-SOAP, WSDL :(

Structure:
-RESTful "representational state transfer" follows Rails CRUD actions centered around the URL path. (look into hypermedia api's)
-Versioned
-Patterned

Limits:
-Requests per minute
-Rquests per day/month

Consuming API w/ Ruby

HTTP isn't just for browsers

gem 'httparty' - simple http requests

in ruby console:

  require 'httparty'
  r= HTTParty.get(http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Baltimore)
  r.body
  r['coord']
  r.headers
  r.parsed_response

HTTParty takes the response JSON, and parses it into a ruby hash which you can manipulate.

%20 is the 'empty space' character

CGI.escape('Salt Lake City') => 'Salt+Lake+City'       this takes care of the empty spaces for you

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
-keep it simple
-versioning is key
-make working with it simple
-use Hashie::Mash to Rubify your results
