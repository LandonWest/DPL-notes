TESTING

TDD - test driven development           \  these are the same thing
BDD - behavior driven development       /

You should write your test first before you even write any code.
  then write some code and test it, and keep writing code until it passes the test.

'duck-typing' - if it walks like a duck and it talks like a duck, chances are its a duck.

Red - Fail, write a test that fails
Green - Pass, make only enough code for it pass
Refactor - Improve code quality. Smaller, faster, cleaner code

Unit Testing - individual units of source code (like testing your models in rails)

Functional Testing - a quality assurance process, a type of black box testing (like
  testing your controller flow, Can a user sign in and update their account? etc.)

Integration Testing - make sure all the different parts are connecting properly
