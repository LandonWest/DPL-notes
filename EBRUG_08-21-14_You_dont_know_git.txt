git rebase origin/master     ??? different origin <space> master, which references the remote repo.
                                  origin/master    references the local master (entire repo?)

*rebase - when your working on something and want to keep working on it
          need to collapse many commits into a single commit(use this for open-source projects)
          need to incorporate changes from origin/master into your branch

"squash"
git rebase -i<commit-sha>

>git log  shows you all the changes in your branch
>git log -p  shows diffs

>git reflog    #find your HEAD
>git reset --HARD    #takes you back one commit

git push origin :[branch]      #pushes nothing to branch, essentially deleting it
